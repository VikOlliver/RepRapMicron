# RepRapMicron (μRepRap)

## Overview

The RepRapMicron Project, or μRepRap, is an extension of the Open Source RepRap 3D printer project that aims to bring micron-scale fabrication into very widespread adoption. The main project page is [here](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapMicron). It aims to use hardware and software familiar to 3D printer developers, and materials that are easily and inexpensively available.

At present, the project is in the very early prototyping stages, figuring out the unknown unknowns. This repository holds files that can reasonably be expected to be useful to potential developers/experimenters, but at this stage there are absolutely no guarantees.

## Roadmap

1. Develop a micron-accurate, 3D printable mechanism.
2. Develop a print head for it.
3. Make more of them
4. Reduce further to nanoscale
5. Take over the world

## Contributing
Please do join in. We need everything. Coders, makers, nanoscience experts, materials scientists, 3D printing experts, manual writers, graphics artists, dancers, the works. Well, maybe not the dancers.

The main repository of knowledge is the wiki on the main project page. General updates go on [the blog](http://blog.reprap.org/). There is some coverage on the Facebook RepRap page.

## License
Everything possible is under the GPL.

## Project status
Pre-pre-alpha.
